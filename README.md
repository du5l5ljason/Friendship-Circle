===============================================
<Friends> is one of the most successful and well known TV series. The lives, loves and laughs of six young friends have influenced a lot on me. I am trying to complete a brief analysis on the six main characters with the data from Twitter, to show the connections between each two of them and also the corresponding words how people describe them.

In Data Collection Section, I used twDocs to get the latest 1500 tweets that mentioned each one of the characters (e.g. search "Rachel Friend") from the twitter database.

Data Collection:
Twitter Search Engine -- twDocs

Data Analysis:
Then Processing is used to calculate the frequency of each word. The output of this part is a *.csv file which contains all the words and their using frequencies.
